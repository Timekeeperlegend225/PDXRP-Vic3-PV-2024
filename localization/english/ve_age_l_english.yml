 ve_age_of_victoria_title: "Birth of Nations"
 ve_age_of_victoria_desc: "In this tumultuous period of transition, nations are increasingly aware that the pace of industrialization and modernization will determine their survival and standing in the world.\nTraditional feudal structures are being challenged as emerging political entities strive to harness technological innovations to compete on the world stage.\nThis race for modernization not only fosters national pride and identity but also exacerbates tensions between established powers and rising nations, as competition for resources, influence and lands intensifies."
 ve_imperialism_age_title: "Age of Imperialism"
 ve_imperialism_age_desc: "The age of imperialism has begun.\nOld and newly established nations aggressively expand their territories and influence, driven by the need for new markets and raw materials to fuel their industrial economies.\nThis time period is marked by a race for empire, characterized by both overt exploitation and complex political maneuvers, fundamentally reshaping global dynamics and leading to significant social, economic, and cultural changes in both the colonizers and the colonized."
 ve_great_wars_age_title: "Age of the Great Wars"
 ve_great_wars_age_desc: "As geopolitical rivals solidify their spheres of influence and the struggle for resources intensifies, the risk of conflict escalates, threatening to unravel the established world order.\nNations, feeling the pressure of limited territory and dwindling opportunities for expansion, may resort to aggressive posturing, alliances, and military buildups as they vie for dominance.\nUnderlying nationalistic fervor and economic competition can fuel tensions, leading to a precarious balance of power that is susceptible to sparks of conflict.\nAs diplomacy falters and miscalculations occur, the world stands on the brink of war, with the potential to reshape borders, alliances, and the very fabric of international relations."
